I have noticed that my typing speed increases faster when I practise specific words over and over again for a 
few times, rather than general texts. 20 to 30 tries is usually the moment I "master" the word and can type it
150wpm or higher. This makes it very worthwhile, if not permanent for typing that word fast,
unlike if I were to practise different words, individually, and rarely repeatedly through normal typing texts.

I believe that for for certain people that type under 150wpm, this could be a pretty useful little program.

Higher levels are of course pretty hyperbolic, but the lower the level, the more common the words become, this
should be pretty obvious from seeing level 20. But nevertheless, even the longer words provide keystroke patterns
that will likely transfer over to other words as well. For example, "<insert word here>" and "<insert word here>" both contain
"<common element here>" in them. This is true for a lot of words in my "level" lists in my program.

Whether this method of practise is more effective at helping you type faster, I don't know. 
But to me, my finger maneuverability is very good, so personally, I rarely struggle with specific word combinations,
and therefore removing the need for me to practise actual texts.

As long as I can type and individual word fast, this speed partially translates to the next
word even if I did not practise that word. Same goes for common keystroke patterns, and so
this is definitely to a degree more effective for me for improving my own typing speed.
