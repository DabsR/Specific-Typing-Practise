I have noticed that my typing speed increases faster when I practise specific words over and over again for a 
few times, rather than general texts. 20 to 30 tries is usually the moment I "master" the word and can type it
150wpm or higher. This makes it very worthwhile, often even permanent practise results for typing that word fast,
unlike if I were to practise different words, individually, and rarely repeatedly through normal typing texts.

I believe that for certain people that type under 150wpm, this could be a pretty useful little program.

Higher levels are of course pretty hyperbolic, but the lower the level, the more common the words become, this
should be pretty obvious from seeing level 20. But nevertheless, even the longer words provide keystroke patterns
that will likely transfer over to other words as well. For example, "anthropomorphization" contains "anthro", "morph", "ization", "ion", which are fairly common keystroke patterns, and I have noticed that this also is a factor that helps me type faster.

Whether this method of practise is more effective at helping you type faster, I don't know. 
But to me, my finger maneuverability/efficiency is very good, so personally, I rarely struggle with specific word combinations,
and therefore removing the need for me to practise actual texts.

I don't guarantee anything, but if it comes out that this is a far more effective method in general, then I will update this program and make it more user-friendly.
